<p>
This document describes the definitions for results data elements submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov for interventional studies (clinical trials) and observational studies. These definitions are mostly adapted from <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/21/2016-22129/clinical-trials-registration-and-results-information-submission">42 CFR Part 11</a>.
<p>
Data element entries are annotated with symbols to indicate generally what information is required to be submitted and under which circumstances. The responsible party must ensure that the information provided complies with any applicable laws, regulations, or policies. For more information about various requirements and definitions of regulatory terms under 42 CFR Part 11, see <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/resources">Support Materials</a>.
<p>
<u>Note</u>: The term "clinical study" is used to refer to both interventional and observational studies. The term "participant" is used to refer to a human subject.

Definition: Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participant’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the participant’s participation in the research.
      <br>
      <br>
Three types of adverse event data are to be reported: "All-Cause Mortality," "Serious," and "Other (Not Including Serious)" Adverse Events.
<ol>
<li>All-Cause Mortality: The occurrence of death due to any cause.
<p>
</li>
<li>
Serious Adverse Events: Include adverse events that result in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
<p>
</li>
<li>Other (Not Including Serious) Adverse Events: Adverse events that are not Serious Adverse Events.
