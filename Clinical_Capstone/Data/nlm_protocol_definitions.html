  <H2>ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration Data Element Definitions <br> for Interventional and Observational Studies</H2>
  <p style="font-size:7pt">June 27, 2018</p>
</div>
<p>
This document describes the definitions for protocol registration data elements submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov for interventional studies (clinical trials) and observational studies. These definitions are mostly adapted from <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/21/2016-22129/clinical-trials-registration-and-results-information-submission" target="_blank">
42 CFR Part 11</a>.
<p>
Data element entries are annotated with symbols to indicate generally what information is required to be submitted (and under which circumstances). The responsible party must ensure that the information provided complies with any applicable laws, regulations, or policies. For more information about various requirements and definitions of regulatory terms under 42 CFR Part 11, see <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/resources">Support Materials</a>.
<p>
<u>Note</u>: The term "clinical study" is used to refer to both interventional and observational studies. The term "participant" is used to refer to human subjects.

      Definition: A description of each secondary outcome measure (or for observational studies, specific secondary measurement[s] or observation[s] used to describe patterns of diseases or traits or associations with exposures, risk factors or treatment). 
      <p>
      <u>Note</u>: "Secondary outcome measure" means an outcome measure that is of lesser importance than a primary outcome measure, but is part of a pre-specified analysis plan for evaluating the effects of the intervention or interventions under investigation in a clinical study and is not specified as an exploratory or other measure. A clinical study may have more than one secondary outcome measure.
      <p>
      For each secondary outcome measure, include the following information:

      (<em>Provided as part of User Information or Organization Information in a PRS Account</em>)

      Definition: Administrative information to identify and enable communication with the responsible party by telephone, email, and regular mail or delivery service. Responsible Party Contact Information is for the individual who is the responsible party or of a designated employee of the organization that is the responsible party. (<em>Will not be made public - for administrative purposes only</em>.)
      <p>
      <u>Note</u>: "Responsible party" means with respect to a clinical study, the sponsor of the clinical study, as 
      defined in 21 CFR 50.3; or the principal investigator of such clinical study if so designated by a sponsor, grantee, contractor, or awardee, so long as the principal investigator is responsible for conducting the study, has access to and control over the data from the clinical study, has the right to publish the results of the study, and has the ability to meet all of the requirements for the submission of clinical study information. For a pediatric postmarket surveillance of a device product that is not a clinical trial, the responsible party is the entity who FDA orders to conduct the pediatric postmarket surveillance of the device product.
